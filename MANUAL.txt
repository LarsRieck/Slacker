HOW TO USE

ADDING A TASK

   - Autocomplete suggestions appear as you type based on existing tasks
   - Use arrow keys to navigate suggestions, Enter to select
2. Click the day buttons to select which days (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.)
3. Set a custom reset time (optional):
   - "Reset" checkbox is enabled by default
   - Set the time when you want the task to reset (become unchecked)
   - Example: Set 4:00 AM so late-night tasks count for the previous day
   - Leave empty for midnight reset (default behavior)
4. Press the + button

Example: "Take out trash" on Mon and Thu, resets at 6:00 AM

CUSTOM RESET TIME
- By default, tasks reset at midnight (12:00 AM)
- Custom reset time lets you define when YOUR day starts
- If reset is 4:00 AM and you complete a task at 2:00 AM, it stays
  completed until 4:00 AM, then resets for the new day
- Perfect for night owls or shift workers

- Completed tasks get crossed out and always appear at the bottom
